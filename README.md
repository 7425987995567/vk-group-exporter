# VK Group Export

this small script will make a list of your vk groups, with names, number of followers. and maybe descriptions. this is useful when you are subscribed to a lot of groups and you want to clean your subscriptions up, but want to retain a list of groups you were once subscribed to.

this script will NOT unsubscribe you from any group, it's sole purpose is to make a list with all your groups.
